/**
 * \defgroup CPP_CONCEPTS_STACK Stack Concept
 * Concept for thread-safe stacks
 *
 * \ingroup CPP_CONCEPT
 * \{
 * \par Description
 * A stack is an abstract data type holding a collection of elements of some
 * predetermined type. A stack provides two operations: \c TryPush and
 * \c TryPop. \c TryPush tries to add an element to the collection, and
 * \c TryPop tries to remove an element from the collection. A stack has LIFO
 * (Last-In, First-out) semantics, i.e., the last element added to the
 * collection (\c TryPush) is removed first (\c TryPop). The capacity \c cap of
 * a stack defines the number of elements it can store (depending on the
 * implementation, a stack might store more than \c cap elements, since for
 * thread-safe memory management, more memory than necessary for holding \c cap
 * elements has to be provided).
 *
 * \par Requirements
 * - Let \c Stack be the stack class
 * - Let \c T be the element type of the stack
 * - Let \c capacity be a value of type \c size_t
 * - Let \c element be a reference to an element of type \c T
 *
 * \par Valid Expressions

 *     <td>\code{.cpp} TryPop(element) \endcode</td>
 *     <td>\code{.cpp} bool \endcode</td>
 *     <td>
 *      Tries to pop an element from the stack. Returns \c false if the stack is
 *      empty, otherwise \c true. In the latter case, the popped element is 
 *      stored in \c element which must be passed by reference.
